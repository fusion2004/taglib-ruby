taglib-ruby
===========

This fork was originally made to get taglib-ruby working on heroku with this buildpack: https://github.com/mrrad/heroku-buildpack-taglib

The upstream repo is in the middle of implementing a better fix than mine, though, so you should use the `heroku` branch until it gets merged into master and into the next release: https://github.com/robinst/taglib-ruby/tree/heroku
